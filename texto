source of product information for potential buyers. However, the company was not profitable until 2001,
while it was still experiencing some financial difficulties.4
 As of the third quarter of 2016, it was the fourth
most valuable public company in the United States.5
 In 2015, it surpassed Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Walmart)
as the most valuable online retail company in the United States.
Could Amazon reproduce its online success in the traditional offline retail segment? Could its current
competitive advantages be replicated in offline retailing? Did this diversification make sense, considering
Amazon’s existing key resources and capabilities, the presence of established traditional retailers like
Walmart, and the market trend that was increasingly moving toward online stores?
HISTORY
The Beginnings: 1994–1997
On July 5, 1994, Jeff Bezos, a 30-year-old engineer graduating from Princeton Univers
was named Amazon.com in the year after it was created. Through a partnership with Ingram Book Group
LLC, Amazon could access books at wholesale prices and sell them online at cheaper prices than physical
bookstores. Within its first two months, Amazon’s online sales covered more than 45 countries with sales
revenue of US$20,0006
 per week. In June 1997, it went public and entered the Nasdaq stock exchange at
an initial price of $18 per share, raising $54 million.
Global Expansion and Laborious Financial Results: 1998–2004
In 1998, Amazon began to expand internationally, first by entering the United Kingdom and Germany, and
then moving to Europe and Asia, including France, Japan, and China. The company included different
languages on its websites to serve these international markets. Bezos was not expecting to make any profits
during the first four or five years of the business. Shareholders were not satisfied with the company because
it was not profitable and not growing fast enough. However, this business model, with slow but efficient
growth, saved Amazon from suffering too much from the 2001 dot-com bubble, and the company realized
its first profits in 2001. Nevertheless, its profit was only $5 million from revenues of over $1 billion. Since
2001, the company had significantly diversified its products, from books to computers, electronics, clothes,
and beauty products.
Diversification, Early Steps in the Service Industry, and Own-Brand Products: 2005–2010
Amazon continued to extend its services through AmazonFresh, a grocery service, and Amazon Music, an
online music store. The company increased its product offerings through the Fulfilment by Amazon
program, where products were stored in Amazon’s fulfilment centres and then quickly picked, packed, and
shipped to customers. It also created Amazon Prime to provide a two-day shipping service in the United

its first profits in 2001. Nevertheless, its profit was only $5 million from revenues of over $1 billion. Since

and beauty products.

                                                     LLC, Amazon could access books at wholesale prices and sell them online at cheaper prices than physical

                                                     Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), one of the largest global online retailers, decided to enter the offline retail
                                                     industry in December 2016 by launching its first Amazon Go store in Seattle, offering a technologically
                                                     innovative way of shopping that allowed customers to make purchases without a cashier.2
                                                      The launch was
                                                     the first time that Amazon really entered the traditional retail industry. Earlier, in May 2016, the company

                                                     an online bookstore, the company had become an e-commerce giant, leading digital sales of books and
                                                     electronic products. It revolutionized the way consumers purchased products, while also becoming a trusted
                                                     source of product information for potential buyers. However, the company was not profitable until 2001,
                                                     while it was still experiencing some financial difficulties.4
                                                      As of the third quarter of 2016, it was the fourth
                                                     most valuable public company in the United States.5
                                                      In 2015, it surpassed Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Walmart)
                                                     as the most valuable online retail company in the United States.
                                                     Could Amazon reproduce its online success in the traditional offline retail segment? Could its current
                                                     competitive advantages be replicated in offline retailing? Did this diversification make sense, considering
                                                     Amazon’s existing key resources and capabilities, the presence of established traditional retailers like
                                                     Walmart, and the market trend that was increasingly moving toward online stores?

                                                     On July 5, 1994, Jeff Bezos, a 30-year-old engineer graduating from Princeton Univers
                                                     was named Amazon.com in the year after it was created. Through a partnership with Ingram Book Group
                                                     LLC, Amazon could access books at wholesale prices and sell them online at cheaper prices than physical
                                                     bookstores. Within its first two months, Amazon’s online sales covered more than 45 countries with sales
                                                     revenue of US$20,0006
                                                      per week. In June 1997, it went public and entered the Nasdaq stock exchange at
                                                     an initial price of $18 per share, raising $54 million.

                                                     In 1998, Amazon began to expand internationally, first by entering the United Kingdom and Germany, and
                                                     then moving to Europe and Asia, including France, Japan, and China. The company included different
                                                     languages on its websites to serve these international markets. Bezos was not expecting to make any profits
                                                     during the first four or five years of the business. Shareholders were not satisfied with the company because
                                                     it was not profitable and not growing fast enough. However, this business model, with slow but efficient
                                                     growth, saved Amazon from suffering too much from the 2001 dot-com bubble, and the company realized
                                                     its first profits in 2001. Nevertheless, its profit was only $5 million from revenues of over $1 billion. Since
                                                     2001, the company had significantly diversified its products, from books to computers, electronics, clothes,
                                                     and beauty products.

 products at the same prices as those available in the online stores. These strategic moves allowed Amazon to
 become a global online retail giant. By 2015, its market capitalization surpassed that of Walmart.
 AMAZON’S DEVELOPMENT
 Headquartered in Seattle, Amazon was one of the big four global digital companies: Google, Apple Inc.,
 Facebook Inc., and Amazon. It had worldwide operations, with websites serving markets in 14 countries in
 North America, Europe, and Asia, and shipping services in 75 countries.9
  Its business was expanding
 rapidly. The number of full-time and part-time Amazon employees increased 47 per cent in one year to
 reach 268,900 in 2016.10 This was 23 times more employees than its online competitor EBay and twice as
 many as Apple, but it was less than 12 per cent of the employees of its offline competitor Walmart. Amazon
 announced a plan to hire 100,000 full-time employees in the United States from January 2017 to mid-2018,
 potentially becoming one of the largest technology employers in the country.11
 Amazon offered a wide range of products on its website, including books, apparel, and even food. As of

                                                           On July 5, 1994, Jeff Bezos, a 30-year-old engineer graduating from Princeton Univers
                                                           was named Amazon.com in the year after it was created. Through a partnership with Ingram Book Group
                                                           LLC, Amazon could access books at wholesale prices and sell them online at cheaper prices than physical
                                                           bookstores. Within its first two months, Amazon’s online sales covered more than 45 countries with sales
                                                           revenue of US$20,0006
                                                            per week. In June 1997, it went public and entered the Nasdaq stock exchange at
                                                           an initial price of $18 per share, raising $54 million.

                                                           In 1998, Amazon began to expand internationally, first by entering the United Kingdom and Germany, and
                                                           then moving to Europe and Asia, including France, Japan, and China. The company included different
                                                           languages on its websites to serve these international markets. Bezos was not expecting to make any profits
                                                           during the first four or five years of the business. Shareholders were not satisfied with the company because
                                                           it was not profitable and not growing fast enough. However, this business model, with slow but efficient
                                                           growth, saved Amazon from suffering too much from the 2001 dot-com bubble, and the company realized
                                                           its first profits in 2001. Nevertheless, its profit was only $5 million from revenues of over $1 billion. Since
                                                           2001, the company had significantly diversified its products, from books to computers, electronics, clothes,
