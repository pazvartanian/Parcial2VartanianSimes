source of product information for potential buyers. However, the company was not profitable until 2001,
while it was still experiencing some financial difficulties.4
 As of the third quarter of 2016, it was the fourth
most valuable public company in the United States.5
 In 2015, it surpassed Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Walmart)
as the most valuable online retail company in the United States.
Could Amazon reproduce its online success in the traditional offline retail segment? Could its current
competitive advantages be replicated in offline retailing? Did this diversification make sense, considering
Amazon’s existing key resources and capabilities, the presence of established traditional retailers like
Walmart, and the market trend that was increasingly moving toward online stores?
HISTORY
The Beginnings: 1994–1997
On July 5, 1994, Jeff Bezos, a 30-year-old engineer graduating from Princeton Univers
was named Amazon.com in the year after it was created. Through a partnership with Ingram Book Group
LLC, Amazon could access books at wholesale prices and sell them online at cheaper prices than physical
bookstores. Within its first two months, Amazon’s online sales covered more than 45 countries with sales
revenue of US$20,0006
 per week. In June 1997, it went public and entered the Nasdaq stock exchange at
an initial price of $18 per share, raising $54 million.
Global Expansion and Laborious Financial Results: 1998–2004
In 1998, Amazon began to expand internationally, first by entering the United Kingdom and Germany, and
then moving to Europe and Asia, including France, Japan, and China. The company included different
languages on its websites to serve these international markets. Bezos was not expecting to make any profits
during the first four or five years of the business. Shareholders were not satisfied with the company because
it was not profitable and not growing fast enough. However, this business model, with slow but efficient
growth, saved Amazon from suffering too much from the 2001 dot-com bubble, and the company realized
its first profits in 2001. Nevertheless, its profit was only $5 million from revenues of over $1 billion. Since
2001, the company had significantly diversified its products, from books to computers, electronics, clothes,
and beauty products.
Diversification, Early Steps in the Service Industry, and Own-Brand Products: 2005–2010
Amazon continued to extend its services through AmazonFresh, a grocery service, and Amazon Music, an
online music store. The company increased its product offerings through the Fulfilment by Amazon
program, where products were stored in Amazon’s fulfilment centres and then quickly picked, packed, and
shipped to customers. It also created Amazon Prime to provide a two-day shipping service in the United
